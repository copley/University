For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?


Java provides several different implementations of the =Set= type, including =HashSet= and
=TreeSet=.  Why didn't it provide =ArraySet= ?  (After all, it provided the
=ArrayList= implementation of the =List= type!).


Coming up with good test methods can be as hard as writing the code that it is
testing.  Suggest some guidelines or principles for writing good test methods.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
I was able to finish all the parts of this assignment. However i had a bit of trouble with the
regex for removing the puncuation

I would say they dident provide ArraySet because the other two options are alot better, and there
isnt a case where you could be better of by using an ArraySet. The HashSet was alot faster than the ArraySet
in this assignment, and i would always choose the HashSet over the ArraySet.

The way i went about designing tests was to first just think about testing each of the methods, i.e. can you
add to the queue and can you remove from the queue. Then i looked at the methods a bit closer to make sure i was
testing all the possible parts of the code, for example in the ensure capaicy method there are two bits of code
that can be executed depending on where your head and tail are, so i designed tests to make sure both of thoughs worked.
Then its a good idea to think of boundary cases, one example is that you shouldent be able to insert null into the queue.
