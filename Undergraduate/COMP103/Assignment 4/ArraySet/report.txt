COMP 103 Assignment 4 
Report on ArraySet testing and benchmarking

Name:

Testing:
Which test methods succeeded or failed on your implementation of ArraySet:

It passes all the tests currently





Benchmarking:
What were the results of your timing tests?
(Give the time to load the dictionary and the time to check the story, for both
ArraySet and HashSet.)

Reading the dictonary words into the HashSet takes 0 seconds compared to the ArraySet which takes 170 seconds

When checking plato the Hash Set takes 0 seconds (i.e. faster than a second) compared to the ArraySet which takes 149 seconds
When checking hamlet the Hash Set takes 0 seconds (i.e. faster than a second) compared to the ArraySet which takes 41 seconds


This shows that the HashSet is a much better option becasse it has consistanyly faster speeds for reading and writing. I dont know
how the HashSet(which is just a HashMap with dummy values) works i cant comment any further.
