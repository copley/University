For your reflection:
====================

Write a paragraph that describes an aspect of the material we've covered 
so far (ie. anything in the first 4 lectures, or this assignment) that 
you found particularly interesting or tricky to understand. Include how 
you went about exploring further, learning about the issue to your own 
satisfaction. If understanding it remains a problem for you, outline 
what your next step will be in sorting this out.

PLEASE NOTE: I used Swing inseted of the ecs100 library for the 2048 game AND i havent submited the Board16 class becasue the lecturer
		said that if you have compleated the 2048 game you dident have to

In my tutorial this week i learnt that generics dosnt use inheratence how i thought it would be.
If you had Arraylist<Object> arraylist = new ArrayList<String>();, that wouldent be a valid statment.
Where as if you where using just a simple array Object[] array = new String[x]; it would be valid. I would of thought
they would work the same way. This is because yea a Stirng is a subtype of Object but a list of String does not have the
same methods as a list of Object, even though they are named the same.
