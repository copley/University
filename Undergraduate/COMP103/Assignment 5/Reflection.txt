For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?


Some of the recursive algorithms in this assignment could have been written
just as easily using simple loops.

Which recursive methods could have been easily written with loops?

What are the advantage(s) or disadvantage(s) of using recursive methods 
rather than loops.

Why couldn't the others be easily written with loops?

Many people find recursion hard to understand at first, although it doesn't do
anything different from previous programs - it just involves methods which call
methods.  Why is it tricky?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I was able to compleat the whole assignment, how ever i did have some trouble implementing the interpolation
search, sometimes the mid value would be to big and i wasnt to sure how to solve this at first.

The loop could of been done on the drawing the stepping stones, and the tree could of been done with a loop to

The advantage to using recursive methods would be that its easier to debug because you can look through the stack and
see what the state of the previous call is, if you wanted to do this in a loop you would have to store everything in extra
variables. Also i personally think that its easier to think about the problems in terms on recursion, it makes more sense.

because they relied on being able to backtrack, for example in the maze search if it reached a dead end it could
go backwards down the stack untill there was another option, the algorythm couldent easily be converted to a loop, im sure
its possible to do it with a loop but you woud have to implement it diffrently

I learnt recursion awhile ago so i cant really remeber if/what problems i had with it but i suppose it is because its a
compleatly diffrent way of thinking about a problem, becuase in recursion you are dealing with a problem in which 
gets smaller with each itteration, where as with an algorythm people are use to are a chain of functions that will solve a problem
