For your reflection:
====================

Firstly, describe how far you got, on this assignment. If there was a problem
you got stuck on, what was that problem?

Reading and understanding someone else's code is difficult.  What elements of
Sokoban made it easier or made it  more difficult for you to understand?  Can
you identify things that you would do or avoid doing if you were trying to make
your own code easily understood by someone else?

What is the point of comparators?  Why are they necessary in general? Could you
suggest an alternative way of solving the same problems that didn't involve
having to make these additional classes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I got stuck on the math for the molecule renderer, i just couldent figure out how they got the distance formula they had
and this ment that i was unable to fix it to work with tilting, alltho i still added some tilting functionaity. On the sokoban problem
i was able to finish it all

The comments where very helpful when trying to understand the code, If i was trying to make my code easy for other people read
i would add comments to the top of functions to explain what they are doing, and if there was some complicated code i would comment
that as well. Another way to make code understandble is to break it up, so rather than hving very long functions i would try make it in to alot
of smaller functions

Comparators are used to add a layer of abstraction to the sorting of lists. I wouldent say that comparators are necessary becasuse you are able to 
sort lists without it but it just provides a way to make it easyier without the programmer having to worry about implemeting the sorting. If you wanted to
sort a list without the use of a comparator you could write your own implementation of merge sort or another sorting algorythm
