Create an empty list to store the articulation points -> points

Reset the depths of the nodes to Infinity

For each of disjoint sets
	Get the root node -> root
	
	Set subtrees = 0
	root.depth <- 0
	
	For each of the neighbours of the root
		If the depth is Infinity
			subtrees++
			findArticulationPoints(neighbour, root, points)
			
	If subtrees > 1
		Then root is an articualtion point, add it to points
