Questions for Reflection.
=========================

1.  What is the advantage of making a DodgemCar class?  Why is it better
than putting all the code in a single DodgemGame class, like we did
with the floorCleaner in Assignment 1?

Answer 1: Seperating the code out into seperate files makes the code simpler and easier to read,
it also is much better practice when working on a program, You arnt ever going to have all you code
in one file beacuse comming back to it later and trying to fix it would be impossile. And finally 
if you have a modular porgram its easier to work on because you dnt have to navagate tons of code.


2. The assignment split the development of both programs into three
stages (Core, Completion, and Challenge).  This was partly for
marking, but it was also intended to make it easier to do the
program.  Why does it it help to have several stages? What Software Engineering
methodology does this reflect?

Answer 2: It helps because then you have a list of milestones that you know you have
to achive, if you are just trying to write a program without any logical steps to folow then
its easy to get overwelmed. It also helps because this way you are able to get the really important
things that are required for the program to functon done first and then add the extra
fetures on later. This reflects the waterfall software engineering methodlgy where
a program is devided up into sequential steps.


3. Last week you constructed a list of the key Java programming
constructs that you used.  Add the important new constructs you used
this week to that list, with a very brief note about each one.

Answer 3: 

Foreach: The foreach loop is the same principle as the for loop just simpler,
in somecases this could be simpler but the regular forloop will always be more
powerful.


4. If you learned any more important concepts about programming or Computer
Science, add them to your list from last week.

Answer 4: This week we learnt about recursion, its an important concept for problems
that can be devided up into smaller problems
